# M8Ball
* I have translated a similar Python program into Java code, and have added more replies from M8Ball, as well as better looking output, such as exception handling.
* M8Ball is for public use and shall not be sold by any individual/company, the purpose is only to demonstrate. Just simply enjoy and ask away.

## To use 
* Make sure java is installed on the computer you're using.
* Open up your preferred IDE (Integrated Development Environment) and run the M8Ball.java file.
* If you don't have an IDE or a debugger, copy the folder directory, open up Command prompt, terminal, or your preferred terminal, and input the following:
* 1: cd "folderdirectory"
* 2: java M8Ball
* 3: Lastly, ask away!
